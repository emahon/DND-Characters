## Features and Traits ##

### Racial Traits ###

Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Relentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you've finished a long rest.

Savage Attacks: When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

### Fighter Traits ###
Fighting Style (Level 2): Defense: When you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC

Second Wind (Level 2): On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 5 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Action Surge (Level 2): On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Extra Attack (Level 5): You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Battlemaster Traits (Level 3) ###

Student of War (Level 3): Proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Regain superiority dice on a short or long rest. 

Distracting Strike: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

Lunging Attack: When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

Maneuvering Attack: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

## Feats ##

Sentinel:
* When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
* Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
* When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.

Polearm Master:
* When you take the Attack action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, or quarterstaff, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. This attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage.
* While you are wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, or quarterstaff, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
